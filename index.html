            This Website is a school activity to make a business website, but since it can't be finished,
            i'll just explain what their functions should be.
        </p>
        <p>
            'Home' menu is this page.
        </p>
        <p>
            When 'Products' menu on the bar is clicked, it should display
            the products of jackets to be sold.
        </p>
        <p>
            On 'About The Website' menu, it should introduce what the page is about,
            like these paragraphs are doing right now.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'Contact' menu should display my phone #, email, and the address of my imaginary shop where all my products are also displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly the search button which you can't search anything.
        </p>
